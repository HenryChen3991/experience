Problem
=======

Assume our customers require organic pizza, this's the second dimension of our product, and also an orthogonality with the existed functions.  
This sample base on the Factory-Method sample which providing standard-pizza(cheese,vaggie) and greek-pizza(also cheese,vaggie),  
So we come front the new issues:  
* How to offer our customers organic type of these four kinds pizza?
* Also our customers can choose traditional type.
* Try to implement the new feature with less and no-invasion code.

----------

1. Dimension-one: We have cheese, veggie pizza.
2. Dimension-two: Then we can provide Greek-style option
3. Dimension-three: Then we can provide organic option for all pizza
