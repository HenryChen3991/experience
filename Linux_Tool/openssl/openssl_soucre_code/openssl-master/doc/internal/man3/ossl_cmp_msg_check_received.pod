=head1 NAME

ossl_cmp_allow_unprotected_cb_t,
ossl_cmp_msg_check_received
- does all checks on a received CMP message that can be done generically

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include "cmp_local.h"

 typedef int (*ossl_cmp_allow_unprotected_cb_t)(const OSSL_CMP_CTX *ctx,
                                                const OSSL_CMP_MSG *msg,
                                                int invalid_protection, int arg);

 int ossl_cmp_msg_check_received(OSSL_CMP_CTX *ctx, const OSSL_CMP_MSG *msg,
                                 ossl_cmp_allow_unprotected_cb_t cb, int cb_arg);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ossl_cmp_msg_check_received() checks the given message B<msg>,
which may be a server response or a request by some client.

It is ensured for the B<msg> that

=over 4

=item it has a valid body type,

=item its protection is present and valid (or a callback function B<cb>
is present and indicates that a missing or invalid protection is acceptable),

=item its recipNonce matches any previous senderNonce stored in B<ctx>, and

=item its transaction ID matches any previous transaction ID stored in B<ctx>.

=back

In case no protection is present and B<cb> is not NULL then this callback
function is called with its B<invalid_protection> parameter being 0, while in
case an invalid protection is present the B<invalid_protection> parameter is 1.
The callback is passed also the arguments B<ctx>, B<msg>, and <cb_arg>
(which typically contains the expected message type).
The callback should return 1 on acceptance, 0 on rejection, or -1 on error.
It should not put and error on the error stack since this could be misleading.

If all checks pass then ossl_cmp_msg_check_received()

=over 4

=item learns the senderNonce from the received message,

=item learns the transaction ID if it is not yet in B<ctx>, and

=item adds any extraCerts contained in the <msg> to the list of untrusted
certificates in B<ctx> for future use, such that
they are available already to the certificate confirmation callback and the
peer does not need to send them again (at least not in the same transaction).
For efficiency, the extraCerts are prepended to the list so they get used first.

=back

=head1 RETURN VALUES

ossl_cmp_msg_check_received() returns the message body type (which is >= 0)
on success, -1 on error.
